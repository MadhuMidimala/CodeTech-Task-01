# CodeTech-Task-01
# CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins

This repository contains a simple CI/CD pipeline setup using Jenkins. The pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes for a sample application.

## Prerequisites

- A server or VM to install Jenkins
- Java (JDK 11 or later) installed on the Jenkins server
- Jenkins installed and configured
- Git installed on the Jenkins server
- A simple application (e.g., a Java, Python, or Node.js app) to build, test, and deploy

## Installation and Configuration

### 1. Install Jenkins

1. **Install Java**:
    - Make sure Java is installed on your system by running:
      ```bash
      java -version
      ```
    - If Java is not installed, you can install it using:
      ```bash
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
      ```

2. **Install Jenkins**:
    - Add the Jenkins repository and install Jenkins:
      ```bash
      wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
      sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install jenkins
      ```
    - Start Jenkins:
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl start jenkins
      ```
    - Enable Jenkins to start on boot:
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl enable jenkins
      ```

3. **Access Jenkins**:
    - Open Jenkins in your web browser:
      ```
      http://<your-server-ip>:8080
      ```
    - Follow the instructions to unlock Jenkins, install plugins, and create the first admin user.

### 2. Configure Jenkins

1. **Install Required Plugins**:
    - Navigate to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins**.
    - Install the following plugins:
      - Git Plugin
      - Pipeline Plugin
      - Blue Ocean Plugin (optional for a better UI)
      - Any other plugins required for your specific project (e.g., Maven Integration for Java projects).

2. **Create a New Pipeline Job**:
    - Go to **New Item** in Jenkins.
    - Select **Pipeline** and give it a name.
    - Configure the job by specifying the repository URL and setting up the pipeline script.

### 3. Create Jenkins Pipeline

Here is a basic Jenkinsfile for a simple Node.js application:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/your-repo/your-app.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm run deploy'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            echo 'Pipeline completed successfully!'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Pipeline failed.'
        }
    }
}
4. Trigger the Pipeline
You can trigger the pipeline manually or configure it to be triggered automatically on every code push by setting up a Git webhook.
